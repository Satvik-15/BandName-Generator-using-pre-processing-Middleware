This is a simple Node.js application that uses the Express framework. It takes two pieces of information from the user, their street name and their pet's name, and combines them to create a band name.

To run the application, first install the dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:

```
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running the following command:

```
npm start
```

The application will then be running on port 3000. You can access it in your browser by visiting the following URL:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

The application will have two pages:

* The first page is a form where the user can enter their street name and their pet's name.
* The second page displays the band name that was created using the information from the form.

Here is a code snippet from the `index.js` file that shows how the band name is created:

```
function bandNameGenerate(req, res, next) {
  console.log(req.body);
  bandName = req.body["street"] + req.body["pet"];
  next();
}
```

This function is called when the user submits the form on the first page. The function takes the information from the form and combines it to create a band name. The band name is then stored in the `bandName` variable.

The `next()` function is then called to continue the execution of the application.

Here is a code snippet from the `app.get("/submit", (req, res) => {` function that shows how the band name is displayed on the second page:

```
res.send(`<h1>You have submiteed</h1>
            <h2> Your Band Name is: ${bandName} ðŸ”¥`);
```

This function is called when the user submits the form on the first page. The function sends a response to the browser that includes the band name that was created. The band name is displayed on the second page.
